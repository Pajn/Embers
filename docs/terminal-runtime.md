# Terminal runtime contract

This note locks down the runtime contract Embers uses for PTY-backed buffers.

## Runtime ownership

`Buffer` is the durable terminal runtime record. A PTY-backed `Buffer` owns:

- the PTY/process command, cwd, and environment hints
- runtime identity and lifecycle state (`Created`, `Running`, `Interrupted`, `Exited`)
- the runtime keeper socket path used to reconnect after restore
- attachment state (`Attached(NodeId)` or `Detached`)
- the authoritative PTY size policy
- terminal-facing metadata surfaced outside layout code:
  - title
  - activity/bell state
  - last snapshot sequence
- the snapshot source of truth via the buffer runtime/keeper backend

`BufferView` is a renderer/layout attachment only. It owns:

- session/layout placement (`NodeId`, parentage, split/tab membership)
- focus/zoom/follow-output view flags
- the last render size used by that view

`BufferView` does not own PTY handles, process lifetime, terminal parsing state, or scrollback.

## Closing a view vs killing a buffer

Closing a view removes the `BufferView` node and transitions the buffer to `Detached`.

- the PTY/process keeps running
- output continues accumulating
- snapshots and scrollback remain queryable
- title/activity metadata remains on the buffer record

Killing a buffer targets the runtime, not the view tree.

- the PTY child is terminated
- the buffer transitions to `Exited`
- capture remains available from the terminal backend snapshot state
- the buffer record may later be cleaned up once it is detached

## Attachment and move semantics

`Attached -> Detached` happens when the owning view is closed or explicitly detached.

`Detached -> Attached` happens when the buffer is attached to a new leaf.

`Attached -> Moved` is modeled as:

1. detach/close the old view
2. keep the buffer runtime alive
3. attach the same buffer to the target leaf

Moving tabs, leaves, or floating roots must never reset PTY state because the runtime stays with the `Buffer`, not the `BufferView`.

## Detached buffer policy

Detached PTY buffers keep the last assigned `pty_size` until another explicit resize arrives.

While detached:

- output continues to accumulate
- full and visible snapshots remain available
- scrollback remains available
- activity/bell state continues to update on the buffer record

Reattaching a detached buffer does not recreate the process or reset terminal state. It only gives the durable runtime a new view attachment.

## Runtime transitions

The intended transition graph is:

- `Created -> Running` when the runtime keeper is spawned or restored
- `Running -> Exited` when the child process terminates normally or is explicitly killed
- `Running/Created -> Interrupted` when a restore cannot reconnect to a keeper
- `Attached -> Detached` when a view closes
- `Detached -> Attached` when the buffer is attached to a leaf
- `Attached -> Moved` when the old view is removed and the same buffer is attached elsewhere
- `Exited -> cleaned up` when a detached exited buffer is removed from server state
